        The University of Wisconsin Oshkosh has been providing the residents of northeastern Wisconsin with high-quality affordable education since 1871.

        The campus community promotes enrichment and active learning with opportunities for sports and recreation, arts and culture, service learning and career building. Approximately 13,500 students benefit from the nationally recognized expertise of our faculty, a wide variety of courses and degrees offered — including 60 undergraduate majors,17 master’s degree programs and one doctoral degree (Doctorate of Nursing Practice) — and modest class sizes that foster one-on-one and collaborative learning with professors, rather than teaching assistants.

        UW Oshkosh, the nation's first Fair Trade University, has been recognized for its role in embracing sustainable practices, such as building "green," examining its carbon footprints and promoting social justice. An integrated Campus Sustainability Plan, established in 2006, guides the University's effort to be a leader in responsible environmental stewardship, education, outreach and research.
