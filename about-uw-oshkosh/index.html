      The University of Wisconsin Oshkosh has been providing the residents of northeastern Wisconsin with high-quality affordable education since 1871. Among the largest public universities in the state, UW Oshkosh is committed to providing students with a broad knowledge base and transferable skills as well as a strong sense of values and ethics that prepares them for civic leadership in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campus community promotes enrichment and active learning with opportunities for sports and recreation, arts and culture, service learning and career building. Approximately 13,500 students benefit from the nationally recognized expertise of our faculty, a wide variety of courses and degrees offered — including 60 undergraduate majors,17 master’s degree programs and one doctoral degree (Doctorate of Nursing Practice) — and modest class sizes that foster one-on-one and collaborative learning with professors, rather than teaching assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
      UW Oshkosh, the nation's first Fair Trade University, has been recognized for its role in embracing sustainable practices, such as building "green," examining its carbon footprints and promoting social justice. An integrated Campus Sustainability Plan, established in 2006, guides the University's effort to be a leader in responsible environmental stewardship, education, outreach and research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Located on the Fox River and near downtown Oshkosh, the University serves the community and beyond through a multitude of programs, services and partnerships, including collaborations with other colleges, nationally and internationally. The University has a significant economic impact on the state and regional community — more than $500 million annually. The campus helped create more than 9,000 jobs in recent years and generated $37.5 million in tax revenue, while students and staff gave $4 million in time and money to local charities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The University is proud of its nearly 80,000 alumni. Entrepreneurs, teachers, medical professionals and leaders, our alumni’s positive impact spreads throughout the country and truly defines “Titan pride.” Their successes reflect on the quality education and personal experiences they had at UW Oshkosh.
